## üöÄ Overview

Audio Companion is a versatile sound recorder for macOS designed for music creators, audiophiles, vinyl lovers, and anyone who wants clean, high-quality recordings. It captures audio from the built-in mic or any connected input device‚Äîand goes beyond basic recording with tools to split tracks, clean up noise, correct speed, and produce audio suitable for listening or burning to CD.

Instead of crammed interfaces, Audio Companion offers a clear layout: record, apply filters (e.g. remove clicks/crackles), split tracks automatically or manually, choose output format (AIFF, AAC, ALAC, MP3), and maintain full control over speed correction. Great for restoring old vinyls, capturing live performances, or creating clean audio files from any source.
